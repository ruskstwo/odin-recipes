    <h2>Simple but full of flavour</h2>
    <p>Ground chuck is a great all-purpose, buy-it-anywhere choice for burgers. 
    But if you want to get ambitious and blend, say, chuck with ground short rib or brisket, 
    we say go for it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Vegetable oil (for pan)</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef chuck (20% fat)</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
      <li>4 potato rolls, toasted</li>
      <li>Ketchup, mayonnaise, shredded iceberg lettuce, and dill pickle slices (for serving)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat a cast-iron griddle or large heavy skillet over medium-high until very hot, 
      about 2 minutes, then lightly brush with vegetable oil. Divide ground beef into 4 equal portions 
      (do not form patties).</li>
      <li>Working in batches if needed, place portions on griddle and smash flat with a spatula to form 
      4"-diameter patties (craggy edges are your friend). Season liberally with salt and cook, undisturbed,
      until outer edges are brown, about 2 minutes. Flip patties, season with salt, and place a slice of 
      cheese on top of each patty. Cook until cheese droops and burgers are medium-rare, about 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Serve patties on rolls with ketchup, mayonnaise, lettuce, and pickles.</li>
    </ol>
